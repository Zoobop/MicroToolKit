# Micro ToolKit (MTK) v0.7
Clean and effective data structures, utilities, and other classes with a heavy emphasis on optimization that also features a 
C#-like syntax that is easy to read and understand while keeping the C++ nuances. This is a work-in-progress project as new
things may be changed, added, or further optimized through future updates.

Below lists the current features:

- Array       -> ```mtk::Array<T, TSize>```
- List        -> ```mtk::List<T>```
- Set         -> ```mtk::Set<T>```
- Map         -> ```mtk::Map<TKey, TValue>```
- Stack       -> ```mtk::Stack<T>```
- Queue       -> ```mtk::Queue<T>```
- LinkedList  -> ```mtk::LinkedList<T>```
- String      -> ```mtk::String```
